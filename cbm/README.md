# CBM (Central Backup Manager)
CBM tracks all your backups in one central location. Never miss another backup. And a backup is not a backup until it has been tested to be restorable. Automate your restores from CBM.  
CBM integrates with Rundeck to schedule backups and to get status of running backup jobs.
